; Simple|Small Subroutine A3 (SSA3)
; One of the limitations with dsubs is only being able to nest 2 times.  This
; is mainly a problem with the print related dsubs as most will want to either
; seek to an x,y location in the fix layer and/or clearing a fix layer line.
; If print dsub were to dsub call fix_seek_xy|fix_clear_line it would often
; be one to many nests, so a bunch of the print dsub's had a copy of the code
; for fix_seek_xy|fix_clear_line in them.  SSA3 is meant to get around this by
; calling a simple|small subroutine that will always jmp (a3) to return.  This
; way we can get around having another dsub nest.
;
; ssa3 code blocks should be kept simple and should never call any other
; subroutines.  They should not touch a3/a4/a5/a7/d7 registers and/or use
; the stack.
;
; Two macros are setup to handle these
;  SSA3 <subroutine>
;   This will deal with setting up the return label and pushing it into a3,
;   then calling the subroutine. Note that the macro will automatically
;   append _ssa3 onto the supplied subroutine name.
;  SSA3_RETURN
;   When in a ssa3, SSA3_RETURN should be used to return from the subroutine.
